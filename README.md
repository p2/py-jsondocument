JSONDocument
============

`JSONDocument` can act as a superclass for classes representing models stored in JSON files.
Classes can be hooked up to `JSONServer` subclasses which makes them storeable and retrievable.
There's even a working class for a **MongoDB** server and a stub implementation for a **Couchbase** server, imagine that!
